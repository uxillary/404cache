## ⚙️ Core Technologies

| Layer                | Recommended Technology                    | Reason                                                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**         | **React (Next.js)**                       | SEO-friendly, fast, free, already familiar, supports scaling.      |
| **Backend (API)**    | **Cloudflare Workers**                    | Free tier, secure, edge-deployed, low-latency, already familiar.   |
| **Database**         | **Cloudflare KV + Durable Objects**        | KV for fast key-value storage, Durable Objects for consistency.    |
|                     | **(Future: Planetscale or Supabase)**      | Scalable relational options when needed.                          |
| **Authentication**   | **Clerk / Firebase Auth**                 | Free tiers, social login support, easy to integrate, good security.|
| **Payments**         | **Stripe**                                | Free to set up, secure, scalable, supports microtransactions.      |
| **In-Game Currency** | **Custom API + KV/Relational DB**          | Track user balances securely, can evolve into blockchain tokens.   |
| **Blockchain (Future)** | **Solana / Polygon**                    | Low fees, high speed, strong dev community, easy to integrate later.|

## 🛡️ Security Measures

- ✅ Cloudflare native DDoS protection
- ✅ Rate limiting via Cloudflare Workers
- ✅ Input/output sanitization
- ✅ Token-based authentication (JWT or Clerk’s built-in)
- ✅ HTTPS enforced everywhere
- ✅ Cloudflare Turnstile for bot protection
- ✅ Separate user balances from transaction processing for rollback safety

---

## 🔮 Future-Proofing

- Microservices ready (can break into Cloudflare Worker modules)
- Serverless (scale on demand, no server maintenance)
- Blockchain adaptable (API structure can later plug into smart contracts)
- UI flexibility (React/Next.js allows easy design changes)

---

## 💸 Cost Consideration

- **Cloudflare Workers & KV:** Free tier is generous
- **Next.js (via Cloudflare Pages):** Free
- **Clerk or Firebase Auth:** Free for small apps
- **Stripe:** No monthly fee, only transaction fees
- **Optional Paid Later:** Planetscale, Supabase (for relational scaling)

---

## 🛠️ Additional Tools

- **Vercel Analytics / Cloudflare Analytics:** Free tracking, privacy-focused
- **GitHub Actions:** Free automation for deployments and stats tracking
- **Sentry:** Free tier for error tracking

---

## ✅ Why This Works for You

- Leverages **your existing skills** (React, Cloudflare Workers, GitHub).
- Keeps **initial costs at zero or near zero.**
- Scales to **handle growth, payments, and blockchain** later.
- Prioritizes **security and resilience from the start.**
