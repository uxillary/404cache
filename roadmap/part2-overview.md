## 🏗️ Step 1: Basic Setup

- Set up Cloudflare Pages with GitHub integration.
- Create a public repository for now.
- Build simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript base files.
- Display basic UI: stock list, currency display, and buy/sell buttons.

---

## 🏦 Step 2: Stock Market Core

- Create a JSON file or JavaScript object to store stock data.
- Write a function to simulate price changes:

  - `updateStockPrices()` function (runs on a timer)

---

## 💸 Step 3: Currency Management

- Add player currency system.
- Deduct/credit currency on buy/sell transactions.
- Display live currency updates in the UI.

## ⏲️ Step 4: Time-Based Passive Income

- Add a basic timer loop (e.g. every 10 seconds) that gives passive income.
- Display passive income rate and total earnings.

---

## ⬆️ Step 5: Upgrade System

- Create an upgrade shop.
- Example upgrade structure:
```json
{
  "id": "upgrade_1",
  "name": "Faster Income",
  "cost": 500,
  "effect": "+1 currency/sec"
}
```

## 🎁 Step 6: Bonuses and Incentives

- Optional: Add basic bonuses
  - Long session bonuses (playing for X minutes)
