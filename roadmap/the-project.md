# 404Cache Project Overview

404Cache.net is a **fictional internet museum and online ecosystem game** built around nostalgic digital artifacts, made-up memories, and glitchy, 2000s-inspired interfaces. It blends humor, retro web design, eerie lost-media aesthetics, and a fully gamified online world.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary

404Cache is a **digital nostalgia experiment** where players explore, collect, and interact with fictional internet relics — fake Winamp skins, broken Bebo plugins, haunted Clippy clones, and glitched MSN messenger chats. It’s part archive, part community, part game, and part mystery.

The site is designed to look like a corrupted 2000s operating system, with interactive desktops, minigames, fake downloads, and unlockable fragments of a lost internet that never really existed.
