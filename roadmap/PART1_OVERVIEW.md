# Project Overview: Stock Market Ecosystem Game (MVP 1)

Welcome to the development plan for the **Stock Market Ecosystem Game**.  
This project combines a simulated stock trading system with game mechanics like upgrades, rewards, and a currency-driven ecosystem.

---

## üéØ Core Concept

- **Pseudo Stock Market:** Players buy, sell, and manage fictional stocks that fluctuate based on in-game algorithms.
- **Currency System:** Players earn, spend, and grow currency through gameplay, stock trading, upgrades, and passive income.
- **Ecosystem:** Supports stock limits, incentives, ad-based rewards (optional), and an upgrade path.

## üóÇ Data Structure Example

```json
{
  "stocks": [
    {
      "id": "stock_apple",
      "name": "Apple",
      "price": 120,
      "trend": "up"
    },
    {
      "id": "stock_gizmo",
      "name": "Gizmo Corp",
      "price": 45,

    "currency": 1000,
    "portfolio": {
      "stock_apple": 10,
      "stock_gizmo": 5
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
*(Future: Consider React or Vue for scalability)*

- **Backend:**  
For MVP, use JSON files or static storage.  
*(Future: Upgrade to Cloudflare Workers, Node.js, or lightweight backend)*

- **Storage:** LocalStorage or IndexedDB (for offline persistence)

---

## üöÄ Current Focus

We are starting **MVP 1**:
- Core stock trading
- Currency system
- Basic upgrades
- Local data persistence

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Summary

- Codex and contributors can start by focusing on Part 2 (MVP build steps).
- JSON structure will be the backbone for stock and user management.
- Simple, modular functions will make the system easy to expand later.
