# Project Overview: Stock Market Ecosystem Game (MVP 1)

Welcome to the development plan for the **Stock Market Ecosystem Game**.

- **Pseudo Stock Market:** Players buy, sell, and manage fictional stocks that fluctuate based on in-game algorithms.
- **Currency System:** Players earn, spend, and grow currency through gameplay, stock trading, upgrades, and passive income.
- **Ecosystem:** Supports stock limits, incentives, ad-based rewards (optional), and an upgrade path.
